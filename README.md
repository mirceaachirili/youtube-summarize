# YouTube Video Transcription and Summarization

This guide will walk you through the process of transcribing any YouTube video and summarizing the transcribed text using a Jupyter notebook hosted on Google Colab.
## Steps:
- Navigate to the [summarize.ipynb](https://github.com/mirceaachirili/youtube-summarize/blob/main/summarize.ipynb) notebook on GitHub.
- Click on the 'Open in Colab' button to open the notebook in Google Colab.
-Once the notebook is open in Colab, go to the 'Runtime' tab in the menu and select 'Run All'. This will execute all the cells in the notebook.
- When prompted, paste the URL of the YouTube video you want to transcribe and summarize into the input cell.
- After approximately 2 minutes, the summarized text will be displayed at the bottom of the notebook.

Please note that the processing time may vary depending on the length of the video.
